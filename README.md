## Introduction
In this report, we will explore the relationship between a set of variables and miles per gallon(MPG). We are particularly interested in the following two questions:
-   "Is an automatic or manual transmission better for MPG"
-   "Quantify the MPG difference between automatic and manual transmissions"

## Data 
We will be using the mtcars data set. The data was extracted from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine, and comprises fuel consumption and 10 aspects of automobile design and performance for 32 automobiles (1973--74 models).
